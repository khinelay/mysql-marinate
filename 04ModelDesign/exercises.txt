1. When would you use a weak entity?
ANSWER: a weak entity is an entity that cannot be uniquely identified by its attribute alone. It cannot exist without the entity with which it has a relationship.
eg., a customer has a child. A child is a weak entity and it is uniquely identified in strong entity (customer). Weak entity has an identifying relationship.

2. Is it better to use entities instead of attributes?
ANSWER:
It depends on the situation.
a. Items of direct interest should be entities.eg., customer should be entity; email should be an attribute of customer entity.
b. If the object has multiple instances, we need to represent the object as a separate entity eg., customer has more than 1 email address, email address has to be an entity
c. If the object is often nonexistent or unknown, we use entity.


3. Alter and extend the music database ER model so that it can store

ANSWER:
Please see diagram4.jpg.  I changed Artist to album relationship to Many-to-Many relationship.

 - There are two types of product: music CDs and video DVDs.
 - Customers can buy any number of each product.
 - For each CD, store the title, the artist’s name, the label (publisher), 
   and the price. Also store the number, title, and length (in seconds) 
   of each track on the CD.
 - For each video DVD, store the title the studio name, and the price.

If you are using Visio, Mike Murphy points out that there is a stencil by 
Daniel Harris that worked for him at 
http://www.visiocafe.com/downloads/various/DanielHarris/Chen_ER.zip

This directory also contains a Diagram4_11.odg file with Diagram 4-11, for use in question 3, and
as a model for question 4.
The .odg file was created on Open Office, but all compatibile programs can be seen at:
http://www.fileinfo.com/extension/odg

Or you can just hand-draw diagrams for questions 3 and 4 and take a picture, as in the Diagram4_11.jpg file.
