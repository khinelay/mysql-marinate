1. What do we mean when we say that MySQL has a client-server architecture?
ANSWER: 
Clients connect to the server to perform database operations such as reading or storing data.
The server is the central program that manages database contents eg., mysqld program is the server that manages databases and tables
The client requests (sends )queries to the server 

eg., we use mysql client program-'mysql' to know the status of database,tables etc from server. 

2. Use the monitor help to look up information on the SELECT statement. (Weâ€™ll discuss SELECT in detail in Chapter 5.)
ANSWER:
cd mysql --user root
mysql>SELECT VERSION(); // output is 5.5.16
mysql>HELP SELECT


3. What is the difference between using the monitor in interactive mode and using
the monitor in batch mode?
ANSWER: 
In interactive mode, I can type in SQL queries or MySQL commands such as SHOW DATABASES at the MySQL prompt and view the results.
In batch mode, I have to tell the monitor to read in and execute a list of commands from a file. It is good for running a large set of operations.

eg., in interactive mode, we have to write 2 commands to count all the users who have accounts on the MySQL server
1. use mysql;
2. SELECT COUNT(*)FROM user; 
eg., in batch mode, I have to write 1 command because I write & save the commands in 1 file. So I need 1 command to open this file.
1. SOURCE C:\mysqlcmd\count_users.sql 
I save count_users.sql file in C:\mysqlcmd folder. In count_users.sql file, I write  following commands - use mysql; SELECT COUNT(*)FROM user; 


4. What do the monitor user, password, and database options do?
ANSWER:
1. user is the username to use when connecting to the MySQL server. default is ODBC for Windows and machine account name for a Linux/Mac OS.
2. password is the password of that user. If that user has no password, it is ok. Just press ENTER. & Connection will succeed.
If that user has a password and don't specify it, connection will fail with "Access desined for user 'username@localhost' (using password:No)
3. database is the database to use. 

Questions:
I have a question.
1. MySQL Administrator program
2. MySQL Query Browser program
I do not see the above programs in http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/ . The link from book.
I go to http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/gui-tools/5.0.html this page but i've got no luck. 
They are the same as http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-admin/
